While the [official font page](http://dotcolon.net/font/aileron/) is in Japanese, other sites including [Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/aileron) and [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/aileron) provide download mirrors for this font.
  This repository is intended to host the same font with different font formats, such as WOFF and SVG formats, for further use on the Web, which is allowed under the [CC0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). A CSS file containing the `@font-face` properties is also hosted to fix font name confusion as in [Font Library CDN](https://fontlibrary.org/face/aileron).
